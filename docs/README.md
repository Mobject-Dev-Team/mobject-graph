## The mobject-server Library

This is one of the many libraries of [mobject](http://mobject.org). This library focuses on the providing graphical programming abilities to TwinCAT.

## What is mobject?

Pronounced mob-ject.

A sprinkling of OOP is usually enough to simplify and unclutter procedural code. However, the more you apply OOP, the more you find the need to expand it's scope to accommodate functionality which is missing from the language. Hence, mobject was conceived. It's a framework, library and mindset of how problems such as this can be resolved using both pre-written code and examples.

mobject's goal is to be a lightweight solution to typical oop problems.

## Why use mobject-graph?

The mobject-graph library provides a consistent way to handle the creation of visual programs which can be deployed at runtime to the TwinCAT PLC. This style of programming is best suited for easy to configure, drag and drop applications.
